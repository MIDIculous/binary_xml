# Binary XML TODO

## Write plugin

### Write plugin - level 0

This Write plugin allows authoring directly xb files - as a base xb file and some incremental additions - at the end.

### Write plugin - level 1

This should improve efectivity - tags will be transferred as tags and binary values as binary values - without conversion to string and back.

### XML database - level 2

This will be coexistence of two files - one in xb format and second in write plugin format and their seamlessly connection in binary\_xml environment.

## Generating readers

### XSD support

I need some standardized format of type of file. Examples are too easy to break and valid XSD should be better.

### JSON schema support

For JSON it would be nice to process JSON schema.
